# 1. What is  Asynchronous Programming?

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks or operations to run independently and concurrently, without waiting for each other to complete before moving on to the next task.

<br>

# 2. What is Future Class ?

The Future class represents a future result of an asynchronous computation.     
This result will eventually appear in the Future after the processing is complete.

<br>

# 3. What is Duration class & Future.delayed() constructor with Example ?
## ðŸ‘‰ Duration Class 

A Duration represents a difference from one point in time to another.
#
<br>

## ðŸ‘‰ Future.delayed Constructor 
The Future.delayed is a constructor that creates a future which runs its computation after a delay. 

The Future.delayed constructor has two arguments. 

The first argument is a Duration object which specifies the delay before the callback function is executed, and the second argument is the callback function.

## ðŸ‘‰ Example for Future.delayed construct ðŸ‘ˆ


```
  void main() {
  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2),
  () => print("Delayed Execution");
}
```
